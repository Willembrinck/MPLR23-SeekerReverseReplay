## Anonymization
Access to the complete implementation code would break anonymity.
This also implies that the experiments cannot be replicated without breaking anonymity.
For the review process, we offer instead extracts of code explicitly referenced in the paper and the raw results of the experiments.
The masked text will be replaced by the actual one after the review process

All the code related to undoing writing operations is in the class: `SkSelectiveExecutionRestorer` (file included in the repository)
